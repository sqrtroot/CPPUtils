# CPPUTils
![C/C++ CI](https://github.com/sqrtroot/CPPUtils/workflows/C/C++%20CI/badge.svg)

this is a collection of utility functions I wrote. I decided to put them in a single repo, for easy reuse. All functions are tested with catch. Some of them use abseil as well

This was also a test of working with github actions, you can see the results in [the workflow file](https://github.com/sqrtroot/CPPUtils/blob/master/.github/workflows/cpp.yml)
